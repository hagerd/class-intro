I interviewed **Jason Batz**  this morning in *CS160*. Jason was born in Nevada and moved to Oregon in 1987. He initialy was going to LBCC for computer science but is now thinking of changing his major to buissness. Jason's favorite hobby is board gaming. You could call him a serious board gamer.

 Jason explained that we are in a golden age of board gaming not just the walmart board games. The board games he enjoys are ones that you play and not the ones that play you meaning there is some skill in the game and not just rolling dice. [Board game geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/)  was a good starting point to find some good games he told me and some recomended games for solo play include:
1. Gloomhaven 
2. Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition 
3. Arkham Horror: The Card Game 
4. The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game
